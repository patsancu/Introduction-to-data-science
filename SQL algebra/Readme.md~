 Matrix Multiplication in SQL








SQL assignment
====================

Matrix multiplication
---------------------

SQL can be good (efficient) at multiplying **sparse** matrices, since most values are non-existent and don't need to be computed.

*Express A X B as a SQL query, referring to the class lecture for hints.*

Basic Relational Algebra
-------------------------
+ Write a query that is equivalent to the following relational algebra expression.

+ Write a SQL statement that is equivalent to the following relational algebra expression.

+ Write a SQL statement that is equivalent to the following relational algebra expression. (Hint: you can use the UNION keyword in SQL)

+ Write a SQL statement to count the number of documents containing the word "parliament"

+ Write a SQL statement to find all documents that have more than 300 total terms, including duplicate terms. (Hint: You can use the HAVING clause, or you can use a nested query. Another hint: Remember that the count column contains the term frequencies, and you want to consider duplicates.) (docid, term_count)

+ Write a SQL statement to count the number of unique documents that contain both the word 'transactions' and the word 'world'.


Working with a Term-Document Matrix
